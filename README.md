# AUTOMEI
This project is a Python web scraper that I built as part of an internship at a retail store. As part of an incentive program,
we had to submit phone serial numbers into a Samsung supplier portal to track the number of phones sold. Hundreds of numbers had
to be entered into the form, but for some reason the form can only handle 5 numbers in each batch, making the already long manual task
even longer.

To solve this I wrote a program that reads from a csv file and fills out the form as necessary. This cut down the time to complete the task
from around an hour (manually) to a few minutes. I could have made it even faster, but I needed to include 8 seconds of waiting time
in case any of the serials are invalid and must be recorded.

Running this code will not work, as I have censored sensitive data.
